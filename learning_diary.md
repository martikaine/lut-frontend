## Chapter 1

- Mostly things I'm already familiar with: git, vs code setup, Prettier
- Haven't used SCSS before, so that was new. I had to install it globally to get the scripts working, while the tutorial installs it locally. Could be a Windows vs. Mac thing.

## Chapter 2

- Emmet is _very_ handy. I now realize I've been writing HTML like a caveman for years.
- Font Awesome now requires to enter an email address and get your "personalized" icons. I didn't want to do that, so I grabbed the old link from the example code.
- SCSS seems cool. I've only used vanilla CSS in my own projects, and SCSS built by others at work. Definitely will use in future projects. Scoping solves so many issues and the mixins seem handy too.

## Chapter 3

- The rotation/translation transitions were new to me.
