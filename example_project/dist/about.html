          <p>
            I'm a pragmatic, solution-oriented and compassionate software
            developer with several years of industry experience under my belt. I
            also have a solid grasp of machine learning concepts from my
            Master's level studies in Computational Engineering. My other
            passions include playing the guitar, competitive online gaming, disc
            golf and tinkering with small "maker" projects.

            I am currently developing

            developer, converting customer needs into practical solutions that
            are usable, testable and maintainable. I have implemented functional

          <p>
            I designed and implemented a prototype web application for
            visualizing certain data according to the faculty's needs from the
            ground up. I made technical decisions, taught myself to use the
            technology stack chosen, and kept a tight feedback loop with the end
            customer during development. Used a flexible architecture to account
            for rapid changes in requirements.

            I tested and evaluated learning material for the Unity game engine
            (<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4302-3423-4"
              >Beginning 3D Game Development with Unity</a
            >). Developed an example game according to the material over the
            summer, documenting areas where I had trouble and errors in the
            book. Evaluated suitability for freshmen from a high schooler's
            perspective.
